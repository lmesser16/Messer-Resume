      <p>Growing up, I loved exploring. I especially loved finding hard-to-access, hidden places. Whether it was the back woods or the local stream running to Lake Erie, I was on the go. in 2006, the guys in our family did a 9 person  trip to the BWCA in Minnesota. To me, this was the height of adventure. After this trip, I began searching for more ways to find wild places. While working for a summer camp in 2013, I drove past a place in Northern Wisconsin that I knew I had to see again. The Namekagon River captured my attention for the next several years. I spent several days each spring fishing and exploring the headwaters area near Cable. The shoulder season offered challenges to a beginner camper like me. No open campsites, no potable water, snow, rain, and below freezing temps. These spring trips forced me to develop some basic preparation and camping skills. Pitching a dry tent was a necessity. Learning how to stay warm in full days spent in cold rain or snow. Basic map reading, and planning for distances traveled on the creeks and rivers back to camp.In 2016, I graduated college. I planned to spend a summer exploring Alaska. Instead, I met a girl in Wisconsin who became the biggest adventure of my life. (I love you, Andrea!) But in 2017, I decided I still wanted some part of the northern experience. I spent the winter reading, watching YouTube videos, and dreaming of days spent fishing in the mountains. Specifically, fishing for giant brook trout in British Columbia. And so I began planning for a trip to Fortress Lake via Jasper Park. I was on a tight budget (saving for a ring for my girl). And so I began collecting gear for my first real solo trip. The route into Fortress Lake crossed two rivers. The Chaba River was shallow enough to ford, but the Athabasca River had a bridge crossing. Unfortunately, the bridge had washed out not long before my trip. So I began looking into ways to cross the river. Canoes were too heavy for the 16 mile (24km) hike in. And packrafts were far out of my budget. And so I ended up buying a cheap recreational kayak. Not the best choice for a seasoned explorer, but I was new and full of enthusiasm. I bought my first 60L pack, and a new Ozark Trails solo tent. I borrowed a can of bearspray, and tried not to think too much of the possibility of coming across a grizzly on a narrow trail. And then I set off on the 1700 mile, 27 hour drive across the Great Plains. Without any incident, I arrived at the trail head at Sunwapta Falls, Jasper Park, Alberta. I slept the night in my car, and then headed off into my first long hike. After 10 miles, I arrived at the Athabasca. At this point, the solitude began to set in. I realized that I was headed farther and farther from any sign of civilization. </p>    </div>
